# Your Tasks

1. Implement additional handlers for different checks, such as a throttling handler that limits requests.
2. Enhance the client interaction to allow dynamic input and testing of different requests.
3. Test and refine the behavior of each handler to ensure the chain operates correctly across various scenarios.
